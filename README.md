Assignment: Introduction to Software Engineering
Instructions:
Answer the following questions based on your understanding of software engineering concepts. Provide detailed explanations and examples where appropriate.

Questions:
Define Software Engineering:
Software Engineering is the systematic application of engineering principles, methods, and tools to develop software systems.
What is software engineering, and how does it differ from traditional programming?
Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC):
Software Engineering is the systematic application of engineering principles, methods, and tools to develop software systems. It differs from from traditional programming since it involves a step by step development unlike the traditional model which did not follow these steps.
Explain the various phases of the Software Development Life Cycle. Provide a brief description of each phase.
Agile vs. Waterfall Models:
a) Requirements gathering and analysis- This is where where the team liases with the stakeholders to gather information about the system and document it.
b) Design Phase- This is where based on the requirements gathered the team develops prototypes of the system to be developed. It defines the structure, components and interfaces of the system.
c) Implementation- This is where the actual coding takes place.
d) Testing- This is done after coding is completed where the system undergoes various testing strategies to ensure that its working well.
e) Deployment-Once the software has been thoroughly tested and approved, it is deployed to the production environment or released to end-users. Deployment involves installing the software and configuring it for use.
f) Maintenance- This is where the team lays a plan on how to maintain, update the system.
Compare and contrast the Agile and Waterfall models of software development. What are the key differences, and in what scenarios might each be preferred?
Requirements Engineering:
a. Approach to Development:

Waterfall: Sequential approach where development flows downwards through defined phases: Requirements, Design, Implementation, Testing, Deployment, and Maintenance. Each phase must be completed before the next begins.

Agile: Iterative and incremental approach where development is carried out in small, manageable cycles (iterations or sprints). Each cycle involves planning, requirements analysis, design, development, testing, and review.

b. Flexibility and Adaptability:

Waterfall: Less flexible and more rigid. Changes to requirements or design are difficult and costly once a phase is completed. It assumes requirements are stable and well-understood upfront.

Agile: Highly flexible and adaptive to change. Emphasizes responding to change rather than following a plan. Changes can be accommodated at any point in the development process.

c. Planning and Documentation:

Waterfall: Emphasizes extensive upfront planning and documentation. Detailed requirements, design, and project plans are established before any coding begins.

Agile: Values working software over comprehensive documentation. Agile documentation is lightweight and evolves iteratively with the software. Planning is adaptive and focused on short-term goals.

d. Project Control and Risk Management:

Waterfall: Provides more control over project milestones and deadlines since each phase has specific deliverables and milestones. Risks are addressed sequentially.

Agile: Uses iterative cycles to manage risk. By delivering working software incrementally, it allows for early identification and mitigation of risks. Agile projects are more responsive to changes in scope or priorities.

e. Delivery and Feedback:

Waterfall: Delivers the entire product at the end of the project timeline. Feedback from stakeholders typically occurs late in the process, after substantial development has taken place.

Agile: Emphasizes continuous delivery of working software in short cycles. Stakeholders provide feedback throughout the development process, allowing for early adjustments and improvements.
What is requirements engineering? Describe the process and its importance in the software development lifecycle.
Software Design Principles:
Requirements engineering is the process of eliciting, analyzing, documenting, and managing requirements for software systems. It is a crucial phase in the software development lifecycle (SDLC) as it establishes the foundation upon which the entire project is built. Here's a detailed overview of the process and its importance:

Process of Requirements Engineering:
Elicitation:

Description: Involves gathering requirements from stakeholders, including end-users, customers, and other relevant parties.
Methods: Techniques such as interviews, workshops, surveys, and observations are used to collect information about functional and non-functional requirements.
Analysis:

Description: Requirements are analyzed to ensure clarity, completeness, and consistency. Conflicting or ambiguous requirements are identified and resolved.
Methods: Requirements are categorized and prioritized. Techniques such as use case analysis, requirements modeling (e.g., UML diagrams), and prototyping may be used.
Specification:

Description: Requirements are documented in a formalized manner that is understandable to both stakeholders and development teams. This includes defining functional requirements (what the system must do) and non-functional requirements (constraints on how the system must perform).
Artifacts: Requirements documents, use cases, user stories, and acceptance criteria are typically produced in this phase.
Validation:

Description: Requirements are validated to ensure they accurately reflect stakeholder needs and are feasible to implement within project constraints.
Methods: Techniques such as reviews, walkthroughs, and validation workshops involve stakeholders and development teams to verify that requirements meet quality standards.
Management:

Description: Requirements are managed throughout the project lifecycle to accommodate changes, trace dependencies, and ensure alignment with project goals.
Tools: Requirement management tools are used to track changes, version control, and facilitate communication among team members.
Importance of Requirements Engineering:
Foundation of Software Development: Clear and well-defined requirements provide the basis for designing and implementing software systems that meet stakeholder needs.

Risk Management: Identifying and resolving conflicting or ambiguous requirements early reduces risks of costly rework or project failures later in the SDLC.

Communication: Requirements documents serve as a communication bridge between stakeholders, ensuring a common understanding of the project scope and objectives.

Control Scope Creep: By defining and prioritizing requirements, scope creep (uncontrolled changes in project scope) can be minimized, helping to manage project timelines and budgets.

Quality Assurance: Validated requirements help ensure that the delivered software meets the expected quality standards and performs as intended.

Customer Satisfaction: Addressing stakeholder needs through effective requirements engineering increases the likelihood of delivering a product that satisfies users and stakeholders.
Explain the concept of modularity in software design. How does it improve maintainability and scalability of software systems?
Testing in Software Engineering:
This is where the system is developed in sections then later all the system sections are combined to form the whole system.
It improves maintainability and scalability by enhancing creation of better softwares, reducing the errors to be incurred during development, reducing the complexity of the system.
Describe the different levels of software testing (unit testing, integration testing, system testing, acceptance testing). Why is testing crucial in software development?
Version Control Systems:
a) Unit Testing- This is testing that is carried out on individual units of a system to ensure they work correctly.
b) Integration Testing- This is testing that is done to ensure integrated parts work correctly in a system.
c) System Testing- This is testing that is carried out on the whole system to evaluate its functionality as a whole.
d) Acceptance Testing- This is testing carried out to the uses=rs of the system to test their acceptance on the performance of the system based on the requirements set.

This testing are crucial since a system is tested to ensure that it works well before being given to the users.
What are version control systems, and why are they important in software development? Give examples of popular version control systems and their features.
Software Project Management:
Version Control Systems (VCS) are software tools that help manage changes to source code, documents, and other files in a collaborative environment. They track revisions made to files over time, allowing developers to manage and coordinate changes made by multiple contributors to a project. 
Importance of Version Control Systems:
History and Audit Trail: VCS keeps a complete history of changes made to files, including who made each change, when, and why. This audit trail is invaluable for troubleshooting, understanding project evolution, and reverting to previous states if needed.

Collaboration: VCS enables multiple developers to work on the same files concurrently. It facilitates merging changes from different team members, resolving conflicts, and maintaining a cohesive codebase.

Backup and Disaster Recovery: By storing files in a central repository, VCS acts as a backup mechanism. It mitigates the risk of data loss due to hardware failure, human error, or other disasters.

Branching and Merging: VCS allows developers to create branches to work on features or fixes independently. Branches can be merged back into the main codebase, enabling parallel development without disrupting the mainline development.

Traceability and Accountability: Every change made to the codebase is traceable, which enhances accountability and transparency within the development team.

Facilitates Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD): CI/CD pipelines rely on VCS to automatically trigger builds, tests, and deployments when changes are committed, ensuring that only stable and tested code reaches production.

Examples of Popular Version Control Systems:
Git:

Features: Distributed version control, branching and merging support, lightweight branching, staging area (index), strong support for non-linear development workflows, extensive ecosystem (GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket).
Popular Platforms: GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket.
Subversion (SVN):

Features: Centralized version control system, supports branching and tagging, atomic commits, directory versioning, integrated authentication and authorization.
Usage: Used historically in many organizations, particularly before Git became widely adopted.
Mercurial:

Features: Distributed version control, efficient handling of both small and large repositories, supports branching and merging, easy to use and configure.
Usage: Less popular than Git but still used in certain projects and organizations.
Perforce (Helix Core):

Features: Centralized version control system, supports large-scale development environments, robust branching and merging capabilities, fine-grained access control.
Usage: Commonly used in industries with complex software development needs, such as gaming and enterprise software.
Microsoft Team Foundation Version Control (TFVC):
